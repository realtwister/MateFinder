Welcome to Mate\+Finder! This program will search for the shortest forced mating sequence given a position on the board up to some specifiable maximum depth.\hypertarget{index_HowTo}{}\section{How to build from source}\label{index_HowTo}
\hypertarget{index_Preliminaries}{}\subsection{Preliminaries}\label{index_Preliminaries}
To follow this \char`\"{}\+How to\char`\"{} one needs
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item g++ (with c++17)
\item make
\item git
\item Linux is advisable \+:)
\item (doxygen and latex if you want to render the documentation yourself) 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_Instructions}{}\subsection{Instructions}\label{index_Instructions}
Open a terminal in whichever folder you want to put the program in. Next, run 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 git clone https://www.github.com/realtwister/MateFinder.git
2 cd MateFinder
3 make
\end{DoxyCode}
 and that\textquotesingle{}s it. You can now execute the program by 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./MateFinder [\(\backslash\)"FEN\(\backslash\)"] [OPTIONS]
\end{DoxyCode}
 or go 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./MateFinder -h
\end{DoxyCode}
 for the help.\hypertarget{index_Testing}{}\section{Testing}\label{index_Testing}
After following the \char`\"{}\+How to\char`\"{} above the tests can be ran by 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make runtest
\end{DoxyCode}
 The tests make use of the {\ttfamily doctest.\+h} framework which is included in the {\ttfamily test} folder. \hypertarget{index_Authors}{}\section{Authors}\label{index_Authors}
