\subsection{Detailed Description}
The check struct stores all the information that is somewhat related to the king, and is used for internal communication within the {\itshape calc\+Moves} method only. On the one hand, it stores the number of pieces that are giving check to the king, and if the king is checked, which squares can be used to resolve this check. Furthermore, it stores whether a piece is pinned, and if so, in which direction.

All the 64 character entries of the heatmap correspond to exactly one square on the chess board. The encoding of the heatmap depends on the piece that is occupying the square. The table below lists all the cases. \tabulinesep=1mm

Some edge cases are not included in the check structure. For example, consider the following board\+:  
\begin{DoxyImageNoCaption}
  \mbox{\includegraphics[width=4cm]{../../img/EnPassantPin.png}}
\end{DoxyImageNoCaption}
 If white now decides to take the black pawn en passant, then white checks himself, so this is not a legal move. Yet the white pawn is not considered to be pinned, as it can advance without checking anyone. This, then, is a situation that cannot be stored in the check struct, and needs to be handled separately. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
